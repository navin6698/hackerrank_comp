Nikita has a line of  tiles indexed from  to . She wants to paint them to match a color configuration, , which is comprised of  colors:  and .

In one stroke, Nikita can paint  or more adjacent tiles a single color. After she finishes painting, each tile  should be painted color .

It should be noted that it is not allowed to apply more than  stroke on a tile.

Given the required color configuration, find and print the minimum number of strokes required for Nikita to paint all  tiles.

Note: In a line of tiles,  tiles with the indices  and  are considered adjacent only if .

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of tiles to be painted. 
The second line contains a string, , denoting the desired color configuration.

For each character  in :

If , it means the  tile must be painted red.
If , it means the  tile must be painted blue.
